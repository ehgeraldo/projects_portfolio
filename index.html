											<h3>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
											<p>Blocker Fraud Company is a company specialized in the detection of fraud in financial transactions made through mobile devices.</br>
											<p>The company is expanding in Brazil and, to find new customers more quickly, it has adopted a very aggressive strategy.</p></br>
											<p> The strategy works as follows:</p>
											
											<li> The company will receive 25% of each transaction value that was correctly detected as fraud;</li>
											<li> The company will receive 5% of each transaction value that was detected as a fraud despite being legitimate;;</li>
											<li> The company will return 100% of each transaction value that was detected as legitimate despite being a fraud.</li>
											
											<p> The final solution includes a Power BI reporting dashboard.</p>

											<h3>Sales forecast for pharmacy network</h3>
											<p>Rossmann' manages more than 3,000 drugstores in 7 European countries. As a criterion for releasing resources for each unit, there was a selection process to make such resources available for each specific unit:

												<p>Rossmann store managers are tasked with forecasting their daily sales up to six weeks in advance.</p></br>

												<p>Sales are influenced by numerous factors, including promotions, competition between nearby and distant stores, state holidays, seasonality and location.</p></br>

												<p>With thousands of individual managers forecasting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of the results can vary greatly.</p></br>
